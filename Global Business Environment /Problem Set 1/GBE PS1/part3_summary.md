# Part 3 Analysis Summary: Twin Deficits Hypothesis

## Question 1: Government Budget Balance and Current Account Balance (1960-2024)

### Key Findings:

**Correlation Analysis:**
- **Before 1990 (1960-1989):** r = 0.8246 (p < 0.0001) - **Strong positive correlation**
- **After 1990 (1990-2024):** r = 0.5331 (p = 0.0010) - **Moderate positive correlation**
- **Overall (1960-2024):** r = 0.6681

### Does the data support the twin deficits hypothesis?

**YES, the data supports the twin deficits hypothesis**, with an interesting nuance:

1. **Before 1990:** The correlation was actually STRONGER (0.8246)
   - Both government budget and current account were relatively balanced
   - When one moved into deficit, the other tended to follow strongly
   - Smaller absolute magnitudes of both variables

2. **After 1990:** The correlation remained positive but weakened (0.5331)
   - HOWEVER, both deficits became structurally larger and persistent
   - The twin deficits hypothesis manifested differently: not just correlation, but sustained co-movement into large deficit territory
   - Other factors (like private savings) began playing a larger role

3. **Key Observation:**
   - The relationship changed from a tight correlation during relatively balanced periods to a broader structural relationship during deficit periods
   - The hypothesis is supported by the persistent co-movement of both variables into deficit territory, even if the correlation coefficient decreased

## Question 2: Private Savings and Investment Analysis

### Why did the relationship change after 1990?

**The answer lies in the dramatic decline in private savings:**

### Summary Statistics (% of GDP):

| Period | Private Savings/GDP | Investment/GDP | S-I Gap |
|--------|--------------------:|---------------:|--------:|
| **Before 1990** | 8.05% | 18.22% | -10.16% |
| **After 1990** | 4.67% | 17.70% | -13.03% |

### Key Insights:

1. **Private Savings Collapsed:**
   - Declined from 8.05% of GDP (before 1990) to 4.67% (after 1990)
   - This is a **42% reduction** in the savings rate
   - Multiple factors: demographic changes, credit expansion, financial market development

2. **Investment Remained Relatively Stable:**
   - Only slight decline from 18.22% to 17.70%
   - The economy continued to need similar levels of investment

3. **Growing S-I Gap:**
   - The private sector's savings-investment gap widened from -10.16% to -13.03%
   - This meant the private sector needed MORE external financing

4. **National Accounting Identity Impact:**
   
   The fundamental identity: **CA = (S - I) + (T - G)**
   
   Where:
   - CA = Current Account Balance
   - S = Private Savings
   - I = Investment
   - T = Taxes
   - G = Government Spending
   
   After 1990:
   - (S - I) became MORE negative (private sector needed more financing)
   - (T - G) became MORE negative (government deficits increased)
   - Therefore, CA became MUCH MORE negative (larger current account deficits)

### Why the Twin Deficits Hypothesis Changed Character After 1990:

**Before 1990:**
- Private savings were relatively high
- When government ran deficits, they competed for the existing pool of domestic savings
- This created a direct, strong correlation between government and current account deficits
- The channel was mainly through crowding out of domestic savings

**After 1990:**
- Private savings declined dramatically
- The economy became more dependent on foreign capital
- Government deficits now had to be financed alongside a larger private sector financing need
- Both deficits (government and current account) became structurally embedded
- The channel shifted from crowding out to structural dependence on foreign capital

## Conclusions:

1. **The twin deficits hypothesis IS supported by the data**, but its mechanism evolved over time

2. **The key structural shift after 1990** was the collapse in private savings, which made the US economy more dependent on foreign capital

3. **The correlation weakened** (from 0.82 to 0.53) NOT because the hypothesis failed, but because:
   - Both deficits became persistently large
   - Private savings decline added another major driver of current account deficits
   - The relationship became more complex but still fundamentally valid

4. **Policy Implications:**
   - Simply reducing government deficits may not fully address current account deficits
   - The decline in private savings is a critical structural issue
   - The US became increasingly integrated into global capital markets, relying on foreign savings

5. **The national accounting identity remained valid throughout:**
   - The current account deficit reflects the gap between national savings (private + government) and investment
   - After 1990, BOTH components of national savings deteriorated, leading to large, persistent current account deficits

## Visualizations Generated:

1. **question1_twin_deficits.png**
   - Time series of government budget and current account balances
   - Scatter plot showing correlation before and after 1990

2. **question2_savings_investment.png**
   - Private savings and investment as % of GDP
   - Savings-Investment gap over time
   - Nominal values of both series

Both visualizations clearly show the structural break around 1990 and the changing dynamics of the US economy.
